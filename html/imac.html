            <h2>The Colorful Revolution</h2>
            <p>In 1998, with Apple on the brink of bankruptcy, Steve Jobs unveiled the iMac G3—a bold, colorful all-in-one computer that defied industry conventions. With its translucent candy-colored shell, integrated design, and focus on internet connectivity (the 'i' in iMac), it represented not just a new product but Apple's new direction. The iMac helped rescue Apple financially and reestablished the company as an innovator in both technology and design.</p>

            <p>The iMac has consistently represented Apple's design philosophy of simplicity, elegance, and innovation. From the revolutionary translucent plastics of the G3 to the floating display of the G4 and the increasingly thin profiles of modern models, each iteration has pushed manufacturing boundaries. The original iMac also made bold choices by eliminating legacy ports and floppy drives in favor of USB and CD-ROM drives, a forward-thinking approach that would become characteristic of Apple. The 2021 redesign brought back vibrant colors reminiscent of the original G3, showing how the iMac has come full circle while continuing to advance technologically.</p>
